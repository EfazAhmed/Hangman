# Hangman
This game was inspired by a contendent of CUNY Hackathon 2021

After competing in CUNY Hackathon 2021, I was inspired by a team that recreated hangman solely 
from using C++ and print statements in the console.

Here is my attempt on recreating their project solely using Python and a text file that contains 
the word list that will be used within the hangman game itself.

The game will detect false inputs and will prompt the user if the user wants to play again. The 
program will constantly update the images depending on the amount of strikes the user has.
